0,B,"Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man
And from his rib an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand

Why do I cry at night still?
Can't sleep without the NyQuil
Stressed out because we fight
Will we ever get this right?

'Cause thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man (No more)
And from his rib an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand (So lay me)
So lay me down in Eden under stars
And show me why it's us that he will choose (Take me home, take me home)
If happy, I would die here in your arms
Don't cry because the ocean makes me blue
So blue, so blue

So blue, so blue, so blue, oh
So blue, so blue, so blue, oh
So blue, so blue, so blue, oh
So blue, so blue
(Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze)

Well lately baby, I don't give a fuck
I'm sick of kissing up, I used to miss us taking pics and kissing
Now you miss the club, I pull my zipper up
Start to think ""Wait, is this it for us?""—Nah
'Cause I fell for you
See I'm the living Icarus, relationships they suck
I'm lookin' around and girl what happened to me?
(What happened? What happened? What happened?)
They hate on me now but soon I'll be winning
And plaque after plaque, you will see it
And they mad at my accuracy
But my swaggy flow can't even rap to the beat
Better pass it to the chief, world is tragic and deceased
Cops selling crack in the street
But you look like the law
I know I broke your heart but I loved you from the start
Baby tell me all your secrets, baby you know this is hard
When I'm crying in your arms, staring at the stars, it's my—
I knew that there would come a day, when you would wanna
You-you would wanna, you-you would wanna run away
Take you to a sunny place
Girl, follow me into the ocean"
1,L,"I could put you on a wave
I just put you on a wave
You're pretty as the ocean
I'm coming with the gang
So you need to get out our way
The ladies love it when I sing
The niggas love my abilities
When I make the fire on the beats
I'm about to make a mil' a week
When I hit 'em with the melodies
I don't care what you tellin' me
Tryna stay away from felonies, oh

Girl, I'm Martin Luther, Martin Luther King
Life is hard, I'm Kamasutra-ing
I'm runnin' through the pain that the youth has been
Afflicted with, it's just ridiculous that you would kill a kid for some Yeezy's
Grab your shoes and give his mom a visit at the funeral, you lookin' fly as hell
Is that really how we're living? Check it
Got a vivid dream of some different (tell 'em)
K. Dot is comin' out of me, the poetry you know it's been a minute
Forefathers put the tax on our real fathers
I don't feel represented, I should be up in the Senate
Swear I feel like Martin Luther, baby, we need Adam Foss prosecutor so they won't
Hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand my niggas to the prisons
Forgiveness over your permission
Just because I didn't break it I'ma fix it
And I'm with my dawgs, I'm finna sic ‘em
Teachers said I need a lesson
So I go and start my own school
And it's a mystery to you, you get it?
Misdemeanor's comin' true it ain't the question
But it ain't a problem, they gon' catch you
That's the mind state of the youth including me
We need some new professors
Were you goin' fast son? Yes, sir
It was that autopilot on the Tesla
Heart palpitating so my chest hurts
Probably see it through my sweatshirt, yellin'
Mama, mama, I'm a mess-up
Sorry, mama, I'm a mess-up
Hit the pedal just so I could go impress 'em
Almost got us on the stretcher
And I'm sorry mama, know you taught me better
You know, you know you taught me better
Father, I don't need a lecture
Man, I know the street is rougher for the texture
And I'm saying
Sorry, mama, I'm a mess-up
Sorry, mama, I'm the mess-up
I just use these 808's to do confessions
I'm double cursing and I'm flexing
Vile person, Man I feel like I’m in prison
This isn't me, it's my reflection
My purities need protection from the insecurities of a section of my soul
I just put you on a wave
I just put you on a wave
Don't follow me into the ocean
You will never be the same
I just put you on a wave
I just put you on a wave
Don't follow me into the ocean
You will never be the same"
2,U,"I was tryin' to love you but we
(Falling down, we falling down, we falling down)
Said shawty I was fucking tryna love you but we, ohh
(Falling down, we falling down, we falling down)
I was tryin' to love you but we, hey
(Falling down, we falling down, we falling down)
I was tryin' to love you but we, falling

I was tryin' to love you but we, ohh

Said shawty I was fucking tryna love you but we, ohh
(Falling down, we falling down, we falling down)
I was tryin' to love you, falling
(Falling down, we falling down, we falling down)
Did everything, I did everything
(Falling down, we falling down, we falling down)
Heart is broken, heart is broken
Gettin' green, gettin' green
Man I'm artichokin', man I'm artichokin'
I can't breathe, that's the art of chokin'
That's the, that's the art of chokin' (woo!)
Send a text, I never opened it
You thought I read this shit? Well I was jokin'
Falling down like I'm in Autumn
All you jokers spitting nada, nada, nada
Six minutes and I still gotta mind my muh'fuckin' problem
Calm down, calm down

Hm, hm, hm, hm, now we're still here
Thank you

Try me, come try me
I wish you could see what I see
I'm late, you find me so timely
I'm lost, baby, come and find me
Girl, I'm fallin' to the ground and you'll never get me up
I'm just a baby with a stack of needles and a sippy cup
And this shit sucks, need some love, my Aphrodite I can touch
Elvis Presley's coming out of me, my head has got a rush
Didn't pick a fight, the FBI just picked a fight with me
Man I cry at night, like every night, just come right here and see
Screw your V.I.P, we are like Adam and Eve, we are like Adam and Eve
We are like Adam and Eve, oh no, what happened to me? No
Jimi Hendrix with the flex
On the Ford motor, rollin', gettin' checks
At your crib for the chill
Who is at the door? Are you finna check, check, check?
Man, you better show respect
Man, I let her go, we both know I had her
Man, I'm madder than a hatter
Played my heart and now I'm swagger than Mick Jagger
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix with the shits, I told 'em
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix with the check, check, check, check
Jimi Hendrix with the shits, chaos, chaos
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix, better check, check, check (you were my love)
Jimi Hendrix with the shits (you were mine)
Jimi Hendrix with the shits, chaos
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix, better check, check, check
Jimi Hendrix with the shits (you watch me breathe)
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos

You were my love, you were my love
Don't let you in my life
Don't be rude to us
Sorry don't be rude to us

You're no good for me girl, you're cruel and infectious
You are my wish, this is me with a death wish
I'm smart, I should get this but, your eyes, your hips, your lips
To me they're so precious, I guard them like treasures
I'd run, I'd drive, I'd fly distant measures just to witness your gestures
Never forever (still flying), the moments still hold us together
Never forever (still flying), the moments still hold us together
Never forever (still flying), the moments still hold us together
Never forever (still flying), the moments still hold us together
(I don't believe, girl, I don't believe)
Never forever, the moments still hold us together
(That you wanna be, girl, somewhere not with me
I don't believe, girl, I don't believe)
Never forever, the moments still hold us together
(That you wanna be, girl, somewhere not with me
I'm crying to sleep, girl, I'm crying to sleep)
Never forever, the moments still hold us together
(I'll die by the sea, girl, I'll die by the sea)
Will you die with me, girl? Will you die with me?
The future I see, girl, will you try to see?"
3,E,"So I dream in color
I found Eve sleeping with another
Take my hand, but don't pull me under

Cause if I fall for you, it's gon' be trouble
And if I fall for you, there's gon' be trouble

Girl I'm wondering, I'm just wondering
Is it just me or would you
Do the same thing to another kid?
Girl, I understand if a heart is never broken
Where the hell the fun in it?
Got my shooters with me when I run in it
Would you relax, girl? We just taking pics
You know I run with the intelligence
Man I swear the city hate the melanin
Just how I hate the weapons that they sellin' 'em
And I don't care what they tellin' now
I be sonning jokers, I got hella kids
Fucking with the clique and you a skeleton
Put a case around my heart, Pelican
Got a couple secrets I don't tell my friends
Started walking slow and then I fell again
Like why, all these knives started falling from the sky?
Man, I’m doubting I’ll survive
Why you trying to turn me into your guy?
Baby, I'm just tryna catch your vibe
Cause if I fall for you, it's gon' be trouble
And if I fall for you, there's gon' be trouble

Girl I'm wondering, I'm just wondering
Is it just me or would you do
The same thing to another kid?
Girl, I understand if a heart is never broken
Where the hell the fun in it?
Got my shooters with me when I run in it
Would you relax, girl? We just taking pics
So you know I hated our relationship
And girl you know I run with the intelligence
Swear the city hate the watermelon and the melanin
Girl, your heart is open so I fell in it
I'ma follow the rules then rebel again
As soon as I can get a whiff of freedom
All these girls you know I never need 'em
Huh, know you think I'm so conceited
My innocence will never be defeated
Huh, lately I'm running from demons
Been having trouble since I was a fetus (Jaden!)
My heart is tatted with the scripture, my chest is hurting
Girl, I'm just a bishop, had a problem listening the father figures
Now I'm on a wave, hope that God is with us
But I've calmed, calmed down
Not as vicious, I'm just glad I got a kitchen pot to piss in
If I didn't, that would mean I blew my riches
Screw these other girls, girl I know I'm trippin'
Girl, you know I'm trippin' on you
I think you picked the wrong dude
All eyes on me, slippin', fall through it all
You don't know what I'm going through
The saddest shit is so true, that's why my soul is so blue
Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man
And from his rib, an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand
Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man
And from his rib, an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand
Falling down, we falling down, we falling down
Falling down, we falling down, we falling down
(He falling down, he's so beautiful, he'll fall)
He doesn't know where he is, he's so confused
He won't wake up (why not?) He can't remember
Damn I forgot (she killed him)
He doesn't remember (he died before)
So where is she? (He doesn't remember)
(Can you hear me?) Yeah, I can
I've been sleeping (Come back to us)
(Where is he?) Right here (Syre, she loved you)
(Give us the album) Your wake up call's coming"
4,Breakfast,"
Alright, nigga, no more fun and games, let's go (oh, fuck)
You, you set the standard for the future generation
What, me? Do you know how much pressure that is?
No seriously... fuck, ughhh
Liar, yeah, listen

Slum Village with the feeling, get a beat
I bet you I'ma kill it (kill it)
Huh, you ain't ready for the realest high
Suck it right between the ceiling (ceiling, yeah)
Look, my flow is sick as hell (yep)
I had to bail my baby out of jail (what?)
I'm doing me and I do it well (damn)
You think I'm wack, who are you to tell?
All you hype boys silly (silly)
You a square like Piccadilly (yuh)
I do not care how you feeling (no)
I thought you knew I'm a villain (really?)
Yeah, I don't like it when these jokers
Lookin' at me sideways on a highway
Cause you know I'm bout to do it my way
'Til the MSFTS blow, Pompeii
Jay driving it the wrong way
I do not see what you're seeing
Lately, I feel European (dream)
Salmon, I'm swimming upstream
Look, I don't know why you would doubt
Know I'm coming for the crown (yuh)
Drop an album, kids want to party
Get them niggas out my house (out)
This is Hidden Hills, how are you allowed?
I cut the music, it was loud (do it)
You don't deserve my respect
When I talk to Kendrick, man, I sit on the ground (yuh)
Just to get a little reference
So we have no confusion (shit)
My flow Call of Duty prestige
Seeing through your illusions (damn)
The Illuminati's real, that's the deal
Write a book so I can prove it (no)
All you rappers just a nuisance
It's always been more than the music
Now they looking at my new 'fit
Rockin' Couture on the floor of a Louis V store
And I'm sorry I'm stupid
Riding to Metro, we boomin' (yuh)
All the MSFTS come together in a Tesla
And we zooming
Annunaki going stupid
Psilocybin, feeling lucid
It's always been more than the music
Off to Saturn in a cruise ship
Now I'm snapping like a toothpick...
The older you get the worse it gets I guess
Oh my God, that shit's so annoying
Tuh! Odessa, I'm constantly on the phone with you
Literally constantly on the phone with you
Yo, can I play you something really quick?
Yo, can I play you—
You're all here and this shit possible, exactly
Look, look, exactly, so, I told her that
You're suppose to usher it in
That's what I'm 'bout to say
That's what I'm saying yo'
He's gotta you see the vision
That's what I'm saying, bro
Even when shit is...
Why am I paying this verse if they don't value it as much
Not even for those reasons that I told you earlier
You know, you know... not to play devil's advocate
But at the same time it's kinda
Difficult to get your money in cash when you're just so big
Yo, Flacko— Flacko, let me play you something


Yeah, ooh, this one's for all of my renegades
Plan B, sippin' lemonade, skrt on the beat like a centipede
(Skrt, skrt, skrt) Yeah, squad fuck with us heavily
Wack shit, I got a remedy, blow up like a couple of enemies
Sideline with a felony
On the move like a melody, I don't care what you telling me
I don't do nothing fugazi
'Til I tell you we amazing, I will be their everything
They're a piece of shh, I'm a royal flush
MSFTS in the building, you should know what's up, what's up, what's up
You call me on the phone so don't you blow me up
Yeah, hah, whole squad blowin' up, yeah
Breaking news there is a band of renegades
Teenagers in north Los Angeles, Calabasas area
Throwing paint, art pieces, blasting their new albums
There has been a triple homicide by a man named Syre
So, you think you can save rap music?"
5,Hope,"Baby girl, I just hope
When I grow up I can know the ropes
Ain't never selling my soul
Guess we won't know until we know
So all I can do is hope, hope, hope
All I can do is hope
When I die leave a note
Until then I just hope, hope

I'm about to switch it on you all
My shoes are bleeding with the blood of Martin Luther King
These ain't no Louboutin, this is for Tuff Gong
This is for activists riding in Teflon with a bulletproof vest on
This is for MSFTS who know that I'm serious
This is for all the delirious kids
Who can live inside a prison pyramid
There's kids in prison, are you hearing this?
Believe me, this not a conspiracy
I don't label myself a conspiracist, I need a therapist
Look, Fahrenheit 451
Building Seven wasn't hit and there's more shit to come
The Pentagon is on a run
I just hope I go to Heaven when this shit is done
Business is business, I get it
I'm just wishing all these prisons was not independent
Lobbyists are in the senate, lobbying to make it obvious
Innocent people are prosecuted for a living
I talked to Juda in my vision, your bullshit is done
I'll be Martin Luther in a minute
Once all the products in the kitchen
Why do you even get passionate when you be spitting?
You know they don't even listen
They care about YSL for life and putting lean up in their fridges
And wearing crosses like they're Christian
We're playing chess and I'm the bishop
I've just ran out of ammunition baby but I'm still on a mission
Your verses sound like dirty dishes and that's just a joke
Well baby all I do is hope
Baby all I do is hope
I'm never selling my soul
Yeah we won't know until we know
Baby all I do is hope, hope, hope
Baby all I do is hope
When I grow up, I can know the ropes
And I'm never selling my soul, no, no, no, no, no, no
And I'm never selling my soul, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Selling my soul, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, ay, ay
I'm never selling my soul, no
Never, selling my soul, no, no, no

Gloomy, gloomy days in Calabasas
City's on the maps and now it's hella ratchets
MSFTS soldier with my stripes and badges
Shouldn't plug the clique, but that's just automatic
Got her number there, well what's her name?
Never hit her up, but I'm so glad to have it
In case a lonely day she'll fall upon me
I can make a call and we can share some magic
Got a psychopathic flow, I'm scared of snapping
Hit them in the back and they don't know what happened
So subliminal that they didn't know
Smooth Criminal, call me Michael Jackson
I would die for this, a suicidal passion
You and I were simply too aloud to have had it
Girl, my ego had to die, ego had to fly
I'm just really glad this room is padded
Because I'm going harder than a runningback
Once I get it all, I ain't coming back
Girl I guess we'll never talk again
Well I didn't know that you wanted that
Could've left you with them other kids
Would've helped us with a lot of suffering
Now I'm hanging out with mutual friends
And they just do a lot of wandering
You want the comma, comma, comma, comma
I ain't want the drama, drama, drama, drama
Take you anywhere in the world you wanna go
Baby you're my pseudo baby mama
Me and you a gang, gang, gang, gang
No bandana, that's no problem
Feeling cooler than a fanna'
Run through where you wanna baby
Fur slips through the lobby
I can feel your body
Laying right beside me
Fur slips through the lobby
Girl I swear you got me
I can feel your body
I can feel your real side of you
I feel your soul
Kiss me through the grills
Go where we go we know, we know
Know, we know, we know

Hey, Syre, who is she?
So, do you party much?"
6,Falcon,"You got the cash, well I'm about to come and embezzlement
I am on a whole 'nother level
I put the bass up in your face and you're feeling it treble
You jokers corny like kettle
My superflow is so olympic that I need a medal
Pop out the bushes like ""Hello!""
I reach for the top, never settle, you say you rock, you a pebble
I'm rock and roll, I'm heavy metal
Where are you now? Where are you now? I'm whipping it
Sitting back, listening, where are you, where are you now?
Whipping it, butterfly, butterfly, where are you now?
Falcon, falcon, falcon

Cops on the road, fuck 'em
There's cops on the road, there's cops on the road, fuck 'em
There's cops on the road, falcon, I'm on the move
Cops on the road, douse 'em, I got you all bouncing
Falcon
I am not afraid to walk the lonely road
I'm so curious of where it goes, oh
Who really cares? We won't be there
When kingdom comes, it all falls do-o-o-o-own

Ooohh (cops on the road)
I hope wherever you are
You can see all of the stars, constellations
I'm impatient, you are beautiful (beautiful)
You should know (you should know)
Wherever you go, I'ma follow
Wherever you go, I'ma follow
My heart is so hollow, I'm high as Apollo
Seventeen, having problems with all of them models
Who got them red bottoms and bottles
We gotta go skrrt, hand on the throttle
Oh, only you could hold me down
What do you think that I'm doing when you're not around?
I'm just at home by myself
Or out with them girls but we both know that doesn't help me
No, no, I'm ready to go, so much better than before
Nigga said I wasn't dope but now my head is on the road

Bounce (got me swerving on the road)
Bounce (all them cops is on the road)
Bounce, bounce (cops, falcon)
Back and I'm relaxed in East Atlanta
I’m an African-American, a variant to what my city's lacking
The world has gone to hell, I just roll up the gas
And pass it all around the circle to my day one homies
Oh, you actin' like you know me?
Remember when I was so lowkey
Chill in the cut with a doobie and a cutie
Man I gotta live life, I know they gon' judge me
(Ohhh) But that's a necessary evil, uh
And I was born to sin like people, oh
(My eyes are right) I'm living a lie
Trying to do what is right, yeah
Go on mama, do your dance
Need my money in advance, the Louie V pants
I'm never playing bout my bands
Kick in your door, ""doo doo doo!"" with the tool in my hand
Raury they don't understand
We had to stick it to the man, we bout to hit the road
Get the money where I can
Let them hate on this event (that's just a piece of the plan)

Breaking news. There seems to be a high speed police chase, at north bound on the Los Angeles 101 freeway. There seems to be two cars trying to outrun police officers with falcon winged doors. This is interesting, stay tuned...

Do you remember now?
Syre, the boy who chased the sunset, until it chased him
The boy who had no fears, until he faced them
The boy whose words seem to never make sense
This is ninety"
7,Ninety,"“Love.”
""The United States—and the White House—smile!""

Come here, mama, I know you want me
Food from the soul, I know you're hungry
Gave you my two cents, ain't got money, but
I'll take you somewhere fun and tell you something funny, hey
It's something funny, baby

When I open my eyes, I wish to see you (Love)
But your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time (Time)
Well I guess you're somewhere with your crew (Crew)
Isn't the first time, but the worst time, and I'm feeling so blue (Blue)
You sit in your room and you listen to tunes
And I'm feeling embarrassed, it's true
You out there in Paris with who?
When I open my eyes (Eyes), I wish to see you (You)
But your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time (Time)
Well, I guess you're somewhere with your crew (Crew)
I'm at the SOHO House
If you wanna come through (House), there's a seat just for you (You)
My prettiest secret, I hope that you keep it
I'm blue as a piece of the moon, and I know I'll be seeing you soon
She said ""Jaden, you are my soulmate” (You are my soul)
You only say that when you're lonely (When you’re lonely)
Girl, I'm surprised you even know me, ay
I'm not gon' fuck, but we can kick it like we homies, ay
'Cause we just homies, baby

Life is a puzzle, it isn't picture perfect
You could miss perfection in it because it is subtle
The storm is coming and it's raining cats and dogs
Stay away from all them puddles
I'm keepin' it humble and noble
I spit that radiation like I’m Chernobyl
On Indus Valley, man, I'm in the valley
Crying myself to sleep on the sofa (When you're lonely)
I told ya I'm more than the kid with a chauffeur
Who don't know the life of a soldier, I'm older now
The world's a lot colder now
The MSFTS'll stay on the up and up, I'm tryna hold it down
They stay attacking us, I'ma just weep on my willow
I look what they saying, they playing as I go to sleep on my pillow
But then when I open my eyes, I wish to see you (Love)
But your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time (Time)
Well, I guess you're somewhere with your crew (Crew)
This ain't the first time, but the worst time, and I'm feeling so blue (Blue)
And I'm at the SOHO House
If you wanna come through, got a seat just for you
Girl, and whether you do, I invited you so
Come here, mama, I know you want me
Food from the soul, I know you're hungry
Gave you my two cents, ain't got money, but
I'll take you somewhere fun and tell you something funny, hey
It's something funny, baby

You need to stand for something or else you'll fall for nothing
Girl, this not my country, we all come from Africa
Now we’re onto something, girl, you're hella grumpy
I think you're just hungry, cause right now you're acting up
I don't think you want me, you just want my company
While your man is —ing all these girls who laugh at us
Girl, you got me running from you, I want nothing
Cloudy days aren't sunny
Girl, you make me wanna dance, dance, dance
You put me in a trance, you never wanna hold hands
But I guess I just missed the chance
Miss one text, she gets pi—

But baby, you could be the one I'm telling all my secrets
When I'm all alone
Baby girl, you know I'm rolling
(—live a lie, I don't wanna know)
Get you without any clothes, I'm focused
(—inside, you could be my home)
Our love is drowning in the ocean, hopeless
I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna fantasize
I don't wanna know
(Baby, you could run away)
But baby, you could be the one I'm telling all my secrets
When I'm all alone
Baby girl, you know I'm rolling
(Baby, you could run away)
Get you without any clothes, I'm focused
(Baby, you could run away)
Our love is drowning in the ocean, hopeless
(Baby, you could run away)
(You could run away)
Rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling
Baby girl, you got me rolling
Damn, out of your control when
I touch your body in the ocean
Then you feel these raw emotions
(Then you feel these raw emotions)
Syre
Passion, Pain and Desire just like my big bro'
What you didn't know it's this young kid's been in limbo
Since that gunshot wound on that hidden road
Lost, broken, invisible
But when that light gets low, he's invincible
So much soul that he redefined inevitable
So it'll never go
So the sun never set at all instead of setting slow
And as the legend goes Syre lived forever on
And never and forever alone, Syre

I'm rolling, I'm rolling
I'm rolling, I'm rolling
Saying that we'll run away
I doubt that we'll ever go
I hope the sunset will stay
We traveled too far from home
Baby, we don’t need a hero
I have never been a hero
Your love always been a zero
Baby, you should be the hero
Baby, you should be the hero

Legend says Syre still exists in the mist, in the fog
Poets say he ascended to the Gods
Skeptics say he pretended to be gone
But I say that he's eternally lost"
8,Lost Boy,"Lost I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room
I was the chateau, I was the chateau in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle on my own
I lit a candle, I lit a candle in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle on my own
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out of my conscious, out of my conscious in my room

You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle on my own
I lit the candle, I lit the candle in my room

It's all lost
Cigarette smoke spark in the dark, ash
Baby girl I worry about you, you never talk
And, I guess that's the way I am
I guess that's the way I am

You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know

I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room
I was the chateau, I was the chateau in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle
Oh boy you're lost now
Voices in your head gone now
I heard you and so-and-so had a falling out
What was that about?
Something happened then she shot him down
Just be happy that she not around
Boy you not a hero, you a problem child
What type of fire have you started now?
That was all your homies, that was not a crowd
Always walking round, head up in the clouds
Keep me humble baby, sit me down
So lost (So lost)
Sit alone in my room waiting for the dark (For the dark)
Cigarette smoke lights, see the sparks (See the sparks)
I seek your soul
I'm trapped in my room (Trapped in my room)

You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know

I'm all alone
Why can't you just call my phone? (I have a question)
I'm here girl, just come on home
My secrets, you will never know (You will never know)
Why are you so incredible? (Why are you so incredible?)
Why can't I be eligible? (Why can't I be eligible?)
Did I skip you cause I'm telling untold?
And I'll go
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
I'm just a lost boy, I'm just a lost boy
I don't look outside, no I don't at all
Loving is after us, I hear there's a love for us
I know there's a love for us, I know you're on to shit
I know you're by yourself
I know there's a love for us, for all our accomplishments
This is beyond our sin, I do not want this shit
I was a lost boy, I do not got a choice
I couldn't live alone, all I got is my voice
We couldn't conversate, you didn't wanna talk
I don't wanna fight with you, just wanna spend the night with you

Syre died in the sunset, don't be like him
Man that's where the story ends, but it also begins
He's building pyramids, he's getting serious
Until he drove himself delirious, like are you hearing this
This ain't an outer body conversation about conspiracists
Even though I may appear as this, see Syre grew a tear in his eye
Because the summer’s too bright for his spirit in the night
There’s a python in the pyramids
Look, this is for the kids feeling lost
Sleep on the street, eating the moss
I don’t got no more teeth in my jaws
Cause I ripped them out, I’m sick of killing innocents at large
This is for the kids feeling lost
MSFTS got you at all costs
Yelling ""fuck 'em all"", we hold each other, we never fall
It’s us versus the all, from my cats to my dogs forever

But that is just what makes you beautiful like watching tulips grow
When you walk, it's just slow motion baby, why you moving slow?
And when you talk, I got my lasers on you like a UFO
Girl your eyes are like the open sea, the simple poetry
This whole generation, OMG, I see your soul, it's older
We should build a city overseas, this country kinda cold

Chance of finding you, one in a 100 thousand, whoa

16,SYRE,"Syre, a beautiful confusion
(I love you...)
The story of a boy who chased the sunset until it chased him
(Where you goin'?)
Never quite sure about his placement
Or where he's been in this pink world
Or why nothing ever made sense
He knew that he had loved and had been loved
But had no chronological order to place it
(So confusing...)
All he knew was that he woke up every day
Bleeding with amnesia and the case of new memories
That he had tendencies to mistake for fiction
(She's so beautiful...)
So every day he journeyed to the mountain to recover his past
In order to understand his future
(I can't remember all this...)
She loves him but she eventually kills him
(Pow, pow, pow, pow...)
Now listen, Syre was a mischief with a vision
But his most poetic trait was his wisdom
(Where you goin'?)
His mind was as bright and as pink as the city that he lived in
And the only kids that could live in this bliss
Were the outcasts, the MSFTS
(Why did you leave?)
Those were his companions
Even though they could never understand his struggles
Through these harsh lands
He gave them the upper hand of his emotional tantrums
Syre—passion, pain and desire
Just like my big bro
What you didn't know is this young kid's been in limbo
Since that gunshot wound on that hidden road
Lost, broken, invisible
But when that light gets low he's invincible
(Time...)
So much so, that he redefines inevitable, so it'll never go
(Brace yourself...)
It seems as though the sun wouldn't set at all
Instead of setting slow
She lies to him and said she'd never let him go
(You're a liar...)
And as the legend goes
Syre lived forever on and never and forever alone
(Syre...)
Syre (We should never end this, I love you...)
(A beautiful confusion, I'm Syre)"
