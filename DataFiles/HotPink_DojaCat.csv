Love at first sight, just a link to the 'Gram
Pussy all pink with a tan
And I play with it 'til my middle fingers are cramped up
Swipe right 'cause he thick and he handsome
Love a sneak peek, when you free? Can we cam up?
No shot to the screen, put your hands up
Make it pop in your face like a Samsung
And that's my nigga, better yet, that's my hitta
He don't leak nudes, and if you do you could go missin'
Met him on Tinder, he just swipe left on bitches
And he don't even scroll through Insta'
